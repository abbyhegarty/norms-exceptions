<h1> The Norm and the Exceptions </h1>

<p>In a data set we can observe differernt patterns or norms. These norms can tell a story but so can thier deviations, refered to as exceptions by Cairo. In looking at distributions, different measures of central tendency can be used depending on what the data represents. For some data sets, a statistic that is more resistant to deviations such as the median is required and for other data sets the simple mean is sufficient. </p>

<p>Visually, these distributions can be displayed as histograms, range charts, and violin plots to name a few. These visuialization help and audience get a sense of the shape of a distribution and any deivations that may be included in the data set. </p>
